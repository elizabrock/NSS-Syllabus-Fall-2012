<h1>Overwriting a File before Deleting</h1>
<h2>Option <span class="command">-P.</span></h2>
<p>Files are overwritten three times, first with the byte pattern 0xff, then 0x00, and then 0xff again, before they are deleted. Only <em>regular</em> files are deleted, which is a limitation of this option.
<br/>
<br/>
This option is not entirely necessary, and might only be for paranoid users.</p>
