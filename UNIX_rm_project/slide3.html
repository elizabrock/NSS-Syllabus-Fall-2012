<h1>Removing Directories</h1>
<h2>Options <span class="command">-d</span> and <span class="command">-R (or -r)</span>.</h2>
<p>Option <span class="command">-d,</span> (for "directory") will delete an entire directory, when that directory is passed through as an argument. This option will attempt to remove directories as well as other types of files.
<br/>
<br/>
Option <span class="command">-R</span> (also <span class="command">-r</span>), for "recursive" will attempt remove the file hierarchy rooted in each file argument. The <span class="command">-R</span> option <em>implies</em> the <span class="command">-d</span> option. If the <span class="command">-i</span> option is specified, the user is prompted for confirmation before each directory's contents are processed (as well as before the attempt is made to remove the directory).  If the user does not respond affirmatively, the file hierarchy rooted in that directory is skipped.
