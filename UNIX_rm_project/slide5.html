<h1>A Few Limitations of the <span class="command">rm</span> command.</h1>
<p> The <span class="command">rm</span> command will not delete "dot" files (system files that begin with 1 or 2 periods). 
<br />
<br />
Also, the <span class="command">rm</span> command will delete an alias, but if the referenced file is not specified, then that file will not be deleted.</p>
