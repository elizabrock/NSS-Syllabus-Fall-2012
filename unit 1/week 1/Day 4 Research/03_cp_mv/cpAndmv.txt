Cp

	stands for copy

	allows you to copy files and directorys


	- Copy a file to a new location

		ex:
		cp fileName.txt ./DestinationFolder



	- Copy a directory to a new location using the -r argument (recursive)

		ex:
		cp -r folderName ./DestinationFolder



	- Copy everything from one file to another

	 	- use the -u (update) argument so you won't overwrite files with the same name

	 	ex: 
	 	cp -u folderName/* ./destinationFolder




	 - Use the -v (verbose) argument to print out what you're doing

	 	ex:
	 	cp -v fileName.txt ./DestinationFolder

	 	prints out: 'fileName.txt' -> './DestinationFolder/fileName.txt'



	 - Use the -i (interactive) argument to get a prompt before a file is overwritten

	 	ex:
	 	cp -i fileName.txt ./DestinationFolder



	 - say yes to any overwrite prompt

	 	ex:
	 	yes | cp Folder/* ./NewFolder



MV
