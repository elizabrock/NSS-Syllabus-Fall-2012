KILL COMMAND

definition: to terminate a process or file

view documentation in command line: man kill

When to use: you computer may freeze and you need to shut a process down without a graphical interface. Sometimes it is faster to use the kill command.

How to use:
- to kill an individual file you will need to now the PID, process id number
- enter "ps -A" or "ps -e" to view all processes running 

other options include: 
ps -A  // to get the pid, can be combined with grep
	-or-
	
	pidof <name>
	
	-or-
	
	pgrep <name>

	kill <pid>

- pid's are listed on the far left corner of the listing
- type kill pid to end the process

pkill has the -f parameter that allows you to match against the entire command. So for your example, you can: pkill -f "gedit file.txt"

*kill also has options. The most common are:
	kill -9 pid#  --> KILL this is the murder death kill command
	kill -1 pid#  --> HUP this restarts the process
	kill -6 pid#  --> ABRT this quits the process and can be used for debugging
	

KILLALL COMMAND

- killall ends process by name

view documentation in command line: man killall

*be careful with this command some programs

How to use EX.:
in command line type
	killall Firefox
