with cat, we are going to concatenate, but it prints it out just like less or more

less lets me page through everything. so does more

cat spews the whole thing to the scree and you have to scroll back so there is no paging

cat can also print more than one file to the command line

cat file1 file2

you can also concat files and create a new file that contains the content on both pages

cat file1 file2 > file3


Other options:

cat -e cat.txt - shows a special character that indicates an end of a line

cat -n cat.txt - displays the line number for each line in the file

Finale
Treat Terminal as text editor to capture input into the file listed here

cat > cat14.txt <<EOF
