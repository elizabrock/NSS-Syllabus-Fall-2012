DESCRIPTION- from the command line help section.


First of all this command (sudo) is dangerous, and can cause irreperable harm to your machine..... in other words, be very careful when using.

sudo allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or another user, as specified in the
sudoers file.  The real and effective uid and gid are set to match those of the target user as specified in
the passwd file and the group vector is initialized based on the group file (unless the -P option was
specified).  If the invoking user is root or if the target user is the same as the invoking user, no password
is required.  Otherwise, sudo requires that users authenticate themselves with a password by default (NOTE: in
the default configuration this is the user's password, not the root password).  Once a user has been
authenticated, a timestamp is updated and the user may then use sudo without a password for a short period of
time (5 minutes unless overridden in sudoers).

When invoked as sudoedit, the -e option (described below), is implied.

sudo determines who is an authorized user by consulting the file /private/etc//sudoers.  By running sudo with
the -v option, a user can update the time stamp without running a command. The password prompt itself will
also time out if the user's password is not entered within 0 minutes (unless overridden via sudoers).

If a user who is not listed in the sudoers file tries to run a command via sudo, mail is sent to the proper
authorities, as defined at configure time or in the sudoers file (defaults to root).  Note that the mail will
not be sent if an unauthorized user tries to run sudo with the -l or -v option.  This allows users to
determine for themselves whether or not they are allowed to use sudo.
