chmod

From the ls command you will see a bunch of gobbedlygook on the left for each file/folder. Those ten characters denote if it is a file or directory. The rest of the nine are three sets of three characters to indicate who can screw around with the file/folder in question.

you, my classmates (or group), others (not part of your team)

Then within each type you see three characters to denote what that type can do to the file/folder. For instance, each type of user can read, write and/or execute the file/folder in question.

Now, to change the permissions for you, your group, and/or others outside your group, the chmod command comes in. Its basic form is:

chmod 644 myfile.txt          This sets myfile.txt so I can read/write, group, others can read only.

How do I know what secret number to type in? For example, 6 = rw, 4= r, 5=r,x, 2=w, 0=nothing

chmod -R 744, forces all files in all subfolders to give owner execute, all others read only.
chmod . 644 forces all files in current folder, no subfolders, to give owner read/write, all others read


For web servers,
chmod -R 755 /www recursively gives me rwx, all others read and execute  This is the most common command and will come up a lot in web work.

Here's a bonus on how to figure out the secret number. Look at the calculator located here:
